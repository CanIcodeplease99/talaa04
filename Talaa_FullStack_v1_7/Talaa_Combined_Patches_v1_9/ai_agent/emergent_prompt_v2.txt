Project: Talaa (Fintech Super-App) — Production-accurate Prototype

Use `openapi.yaml` + `tokens.json` to generate the client. Base URL from env: API_BASE.

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS (light & dark; Royal Blue → Indigo; subtle soft-violet accents):
- General: rounded 16pt cards; 44pt min tap targets; iOS-safe areas; empty states with tasteful illustration placeholders; pull-to-refresh.
- Motion: Send button slow pulse (1200ms); card shimmer on Home (1800ms) only on first load; bottom-tab fade when changing tabs; Confirm modal slides up 320ms.
- Accessibility: large text friendly; high-contrast mode variant; content labels on all icons.
- Privacy: amounts hidden until FaceID; small “Hide” eye icon in header toggles local preference.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Only call endpoints in openapi.yaml. Others mock.
- Persist: banner dismissed, last-unlocked state, recent recipients, and selected instant/standard preference.
- Folder structure: screens/, widgets/, services/, theme/, api/ (generated from OpenAPI).

Deliverables
- Buildable project with typed OpenAPI client, tokens-based theming, and the above screens/flows wired.
- README that lists where each API call lives.
